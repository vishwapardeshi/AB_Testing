# A/B Testing 

A/B Testing is a user experience methodology. It is essentially an experiment where two or more variants of a page are shown to users at random, and statistical analysis is used to determine which variation performs better for a given conversion goal. It involves splitting the user group into two - A(Control) and B(Variant) Groups.

The experimental design of A/B test will be explored along with two types of experiments
1. Randomized Design
2. Matched-Pair Design

## When to use A/B Testing?
A/B Testing can be used to solve business problems when you don't have enough data to use modeling techniques.

### Business Scenario

Consider that you are working as a product manager of a toy manufacturing company. A new product is ready for distribution but the company is unsure of its success. 

In this scenario, A/B testing can be used to predict the effect on sales if the new toy is introduced. This will help the management determine if it should go into full distribution. A/B test is a natural choice as we have first a binary situation and second no past information to build models. 

## Terminologies
In A/B test, we design experiments. 

**1. Unit** - In an experiment in a test, each individual is called an unit. In our case, it is a shop. 

**2. Treatment Group** - Collection of units getting the treatment. Treatment is the change we are testing. Treatment group is the one where the new product will be sold.

**3. Control Group** - Baseline comparison for the treatment group. The control group is the one where the new product will not be sold. 

**4. Target Variable** - The variable for which we are trying to predict the outcome for. In our case, the target variable is the sales.

**5. Experimental Variables** - It is also known as the treatment/independent variables. This is the variable we change to see how it impacts the target variable.

**6. Control Variables** -
