# A/B Testing 

A/B Testing is a user experience methodology. It is essentially an experiment where two or more variants of a page are shown to users at random, and statistical analysis is used to determine which variation performs better for a given conversion goal. It involves splitting the user group into two - A(Control) and B(Variant) Groups.

The experimental design of A/B test will be explored along with two types of experiments
1. Randomized Design
2. Matched-Pair Design

## When to use A/B Testing?
A/B Testing can be used to solve business problems when you don't have enough data to use modeling techniques.

#### Business Scenario - New Product Introduction

Consider that you are working as a product manager of a toy manufacturing company. A new product is ready for distribution but the company is unsure of its success. 

In this scenario, A/B testing can be used to predict the effect on sales if the new toy is introduced. This will help the management determine if it should go into full distribution. A/B test is a natural choice as we have first a binary situation and second no past information to build models. 

## Terminologies
In A/B test, we design experiments. 

**1. Unit** - In an experiment in a test, each individual is called an unit. In our case, it is a shop. 

**2. Treatment Group** - Collection of units getting the treatment. Treatment is the change we are testing. Treatment group is the one where the new product will be sold.

**3. Control Group** - Baseline comparison for the treatment group. The control group is the one where the new product will not be sold. 

**4. Target Variable** - The variable for which we are trying to predict the outcome for. In our case, the target variable is the sales.

**5. Experimental Variables** - It is also known as the treatment/independent variables. This is the variable we change to see how it impacts the target variable. In our case, the experimental variable is the sale of the new toy.

**6. Control Variables** - The data we have about the units are called control variables. They are the variables which are most influential wrt target variables. In our case, the additional information which we can have about the store are customer demographics, location and sales are our control variables. *Different than predictor variable as they are used to ensure that the treatment and control units are as similar to each other as possible.* This is important as we want to measure the impact of the product launch independent of other factors.
